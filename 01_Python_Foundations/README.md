# ⚡ Cipher Engine
A small Python project using **Dictionaries** to map characters to custom symbols for basic encryption.

##  Concept
- Uses a **Hash Map (Dictionary)** for $O(1)$ lookup speed.
- Practice with string manipulation and user input.

🌐 Vector-Vision: 3D Linear Combination Visualizer

A Python-based tool built to visualize the Geometry of Linear Equations, specifically focusing on the concepts of Span, Linear Independence, and Subspaces as taught in MIT’s 18.06 (Gilbert Strang).
🎯 Purpose

This project was developed during my GATE DA 2026 preparation to bridge the gap between abstract Linear Algebra theory and practical Data Science implementation. It visualizes how two vectors in R3 combine to form a 2D plane (the Column Space).
🛠️ Tech Stack

    Python 3.9+

    NumPy: Used for vector operations and generating the coordinate meshgrid.

    Matplotlib: Used for 3D rendering and surface plotting.

🧠 Core Concepts Visualized

    The Column Picture: Visualizing Ax as a linear combination of the columns of A.

    Linear Independence: * If vectors v and w are independent, they span a 2D Plane.

        If they are dependent (e.g., w=2v), the span collapses into a 1D Line.

    Span: Every point on the rendered "surface" represents a possible solution to the system cv+dw.
